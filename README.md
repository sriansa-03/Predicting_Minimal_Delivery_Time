# Predicting_Minimal_Delivery_Time

PREDICTING MINIMAL DELIVERY TIME FOR MATERIAL PROCUREMENT USING DATA ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING

Project Overview

In the realm of data analysis, the efficient and timely delivery of materials is a critical aspect of supply chain management. To optimize the process, it becomes necessary to develop analytical models that can provide supplier details by processing different algorithms on historical procurement datasets to predict/propose shorter delivery time for the future procurements. These models works on various independent variables to predicts results of the dependent variables that helps in taking decisions to support optimised business results. 


Key Features

1. Predictive Analytics: Analyses historical procurement data and predicts delivery timeframes for future purchases using complex algorithms.

2. Variable Exploration: Investigates various independent factors in order to understand their impact on delivery timeframes and make appropriate choices.

3. Optimised Decision Support: Delivers actionable insights for optimising supply chain procedures and optimising material delivery.


Technologies Used

1. Python
2. Data Analysis Libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
3. Machine Learning Libraries (Scikit-learn)
4. Jupyter Notebooks
